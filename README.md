# Blud---1st ever attempt at world design

These are screenshots from my first ever attempt at building a world, with no experience with this stuff before or with unity's software. I had no idea you could create terrain without using assets or even snap objects together or to the ground! All of what i did here i did with a Â£9 synty low poly pack and had major restrictions on the amount of assets i had available. This isnt the finished product its just an example of my creativity. I am currently working through a number of online courses with Unity while continuing to work on a more realistic world for a game called voidfall. I am learning incredibly fast. Check out my other branches to have a peek!
