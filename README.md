# Blud--- Completed courses / experience


**My journey started with Unity's online course "learn with code"**

I learned how to create basic mono behaviour scripts and had a functioning demo where I could drive around in a car colliding with objects using a rigidbody concept. After completing the online course I decided to make my own low poly world and apply the same things I leanred there, so i could practice and develop my skills further. This is the low poly world you see in the branch named "1st ever attempt at world building". After having a "zombie" character that I could run around with and a car that i could drive in a world that I had built i realised my pure enjoyment and absolute obsession I had for what i was doing needed to be acted upon. This is what i wanted to do for a career as a child and as an adult i'm having this experience that i still cannot ignore. So I put down the tools, sold my business as an arborist and now every day, I continue to hunt for internships, work experience or any foot in the door to the game developing industry. It's not easy but every day i continue to fight for my dream. These commitments that I have made show that i am serious about my career change. I have always had such a passion for animation and video games and I cannot ignore it any longer. This is why I have decided to tackle these extra pathways courses to further develop my skills and to prove my dedication. I will become a game developer and I will be a valuable member of a developing team one day.

**These pathway courses consist of the following;** 

*- Unity Essentials*

*- Junior Programmer*

*- Creative Core*

  Once completed, I will upload proof of completion but for now i am continuing to work on the voidfall game alongside completing this lengthy courses.



  **UPDATE No.1**

 * - Unity Pathway 3D Essentials first project completed. The project was to design a small bedroom with the provided assets and add a bouncing ball that collides with a "tower block" mesh colliders and rigid body physics. I was instructed to Increase the balls mass to make the blocks really fly when the ball hits, however i spent a little more time trying to give it a more realistic fall.  Heres a screen shot of the "scene view" and a link to a screen recording of the "game view" in play.*
