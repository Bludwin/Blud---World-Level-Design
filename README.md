# Blud--- Completed courses / experience

My journey started with Unity's online course "learn with code" 

I learned how to create basic mono behaviour scripts and had a functioning demo where i could drive around in a car colliding with objects using a rigidbody concept. I thoroughly enjoyed this and have decided to complete the three pathway courses that interest me, available through unity. These consist of the following; 

- Unity Essentials

- Junior Programmer

- Creative Core

  Once completed, I will upload proof of completion but for now i am continuing to work on the voidfall game alongside completing this lengthy courses.
