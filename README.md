# Blud---World-Level-Designer
This Repository serves as my portfolio. I am new to the industry and have started to develop my skills through Unity, building worlds and creating basic scripts using C#

I am 29 year old male from south wales U.K. My journey started with unity's online "create with code" courses and from there fell in love with the world design and decided to work on my own low poly world, this work was immediately loved by others and i was invited to have the role of level designer, working on a game called voidfall.

My skills are fast developing and my creative approach to world design comes naturally. 

I am currently seeking a full time career within the game development industry to work in level design / world design. I hope you enoy what is to be added as i continue my journey towards my goals & continue to work with the voidfall dev team to complete a finished product of our beautiful game. 

PEACE :) 

I also run a xbox dayz community server & a gaming hub for apocalypse games and free console coding  / .json services for dayz
