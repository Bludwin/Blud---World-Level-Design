# Blud--- Completed courses / experience

My journey started with Unity's online course "learn with code" 


I learned how to create basic mono behaviour scripts and had a functioning demo where i could drive around in a car colliding with objects using a rigidbody concept. I thoroughly enjoyed this and have decided to complete the three pathway courses that interest me, available through unity. These consist of the following; 


*- Unity Essentials*

*- Junior Programmer*

*- Creative Core*

  Once completed, I will upload proof of completion but for now i am continuing to work on the voidfall game alongside completing this lengthy courses.



  **UPDATE No.1**

 * - Unity Pathway 3D Essentials first project completed. The project was to design a small bedroom with the provided assets and add a bouncing ball that collides with a "tower block" mesh colliders and rigid body physics. I was instructed to Increase the balls mass to make the blocks really fly when the ball hits, however i spent a little more time trying to give it a more realistic fall.  Heres a screen shot of the "scene view" and a link to a screen recording of the "game view" in play.*
